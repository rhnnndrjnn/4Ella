        <p>
          This is our first Valentine’s Day, and honestly, I didn’t know how to
          put into words what this day means to me, until I realized it’s not
          really about the day at all. It’s about you. Also, I didn't really
          know paano natin sha macecelebrate, buong week ako nag-iisip kung
          paano ako magkakapera, paano kita mattreat kaso huhu wala talaga akong
          maitabi kasi puro po kami ambagan, and also, wala rin time kasi halos
          araw-araw, padagdag nang padagdag ‘yung gawain ko po, I’m really sorry
          for that baby. (ps: sorry sa font, cute n'ya kasi, hehe)
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          I never imagined that our first Valentine’s would be like this. Not
          seeing each other, no dates, no flowers, wala lahat:( huhu, kinda feel
          bad again, haha, I hope na hindi mo po ako macompare sa iba kasi I
          can't afford po talaga right now, ngayon lang ako naging broke as fuck
          nang malala kasi nga, may pinag-iipunan din po pero I know na
          maiintindihan mo po ‘yung situation ko, I'll make bawi po love love,
          not for now, but I will, hindi ako papayag na hindi ako makakabawi sa
          susunod.
        </p>

          iiiloooooveeeeeyouuuusooomuccchhhh love loveeeee. Not just in a simple
          way, but in all the small, detailed ways. I love the way you walk, the
          way you talk, the way you express yourself without even trying. I love
          the way you exist. Sometimes I catch myself thinking about you doing
          the most ordinary things, and somehow they become beautiful just
          because it’s you, sabi mo nga, ikaw na ‘yan oh. To me, you are
          beautiful always, in all waysss, and sana hindi mo sha kinakalimutan,
          but I’m always here po to remind you how beautiful you are, in every
          kind of way. You have that time na hindi ikaw nagagandahan sa sarili
          mo, and that's totally normal baby, mostly kapag nagkakaro’n ka, pero
          love love, I swear (yes, isa ‘to sa mga bagay na kaya kong ipangako),
          I swear, ur sooooo beautiful, soooooooo sooooo preeeetttyyyy in
          everrrryyyy singleeee wayyyyy, likkeeee uggghhhhh gandaaaa palagiiiii,
          sooo muccchhh, kahit masungit, maganda pa rin, kahit galittt, sobrang
          ganda pa rin, hindi mo talaga masasabing maghahanap ako ng iba kasi
          araw-araw kitang pinapangarap, crush na crush po kita, sana
          macrushback, alam mo ‘yung part na girlfriend na kita pero crush pa
          rin kita and handa akong ligawan ka araw-araw kahit tayo na, hehe,
          gano’n kita kamahal.
        </p>

          I got to see my Facebook memory of February, guess what, what I saw is
          yung picture ko that time na hinahanap ko pa sarili ko, and kahit
          picture lang sha, naaalala ko ‘yung nararamdaman ko that time, it
          feels so heavy, and it feels not me. And every time I ask myself what
          my worth is now, you come to my mind. Not because you define me, but
          because you helped me remember who I am. You taught me how to value
          myself again, how to love myself in ways I had forgotten. You showed
          me that I deserve care, patience, and genuine love. And honestly,
          never ako nagmahal ng ganito sa isang tao and never ko minahal ‘yung
          sarili ko ng ganito, totoo nga sabi nila, kapag tinarato ka nang tama,
          mattrato mo rin nang tama mismo ‘yung sarili mo, iloveeeeyouuuuuu
          talagaaa

          There are moments when I hurt myself emotionally and physically, when
          I’m too hard on myself, and I realized something important, when I
          hurt myself, it feels like I’m hurting you too. That’s how deeply
          you’re connected to me. You made me want to take care of myself, not
          just for me, but because I know my pain would never be something you
          want for me. Loving you made me want to be kinder to myself.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          You mean so much to me love love. More than words can fully explain.
          You’re not just someone I love, but you’re someone I treasure, someone
          I respect, someone I genuinely want to protect and support. You
          deserve all the good things in this world. You deserve love that’s
          patient, gentle, and sincere. Deserve mo ako, ay.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          I’m sorry that right now, I can’t afford anything material. No
          flowers, no fancy gifts, no expensive surprises. I know Valentine’s
          Day is often filled with those things, and I wish I could give them to
          you. But what I can give you is ahmmmm, kiss?!?! Kaso online kiss lang
          po muna, wala pa ako money. That’s why I made this for you.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          And I can confidently say that one day, when we’re finally successful,
          when life becomes a little kinder to us, I will buy you flowers. Not
          just on Valentine’s Day, araw-araw kitang liligawan. Because you
          deserve to be reminded, again and again, how special you are.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Hindi ko na po papahabain nang todo kasi mauubusan ako ng sasabihin sa
          monthsary letter naman hehe. Thank you for loving me the way you do.
          Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for being the greatest blessing.
          I will choose you every day, every month, every year, and every
          Valentine’s Day to come. I loovveeeeeee yoooouuuu sooo muuucchhhh myyy
          preeetttyyy prreeetttyyy perrrfecccttt womaannn
